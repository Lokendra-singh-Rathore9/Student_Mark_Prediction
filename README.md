Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-project.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd ml-project

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare data:

python preprocess.py

Train the model:

python train.py

Make predictions:

python predict.py

Results

The model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The predictions are visualized using graphs to better understand performance.
